FAQs for Veterans

*DHP Fitbit Pilot 

Why are we doing this pilot with Fitbit?
The goal of the Digital Health Platform Fitbit pilot (the “Pilot”) is to help the VA understand the best ways for Veterans to connect and share their connected device data (i.e., data from a Fitbit) with their VA care team. By volunteering to connect your device, you will be helping the VA and other Veterans by supporting an early-stage evaluation of a new offering from VA. We expect this pilot to take about 6 to 12 months, and your ability to connect your device with the VA to share data through the Digital Health Platform may be discontinued after the pilot is over. There may still be other ways for you to keep sharing the data with your care team at that time, and we will let you know about any available options after the Pilot is over. The Pilot is not meant to replace normal care activities between you and your VA care team. 

Do I have to participate in this pilot?
It is your decision to be part of this Pilot program. It is completely voluntary. Your participation is voluntary, and you have the right to refuse to participate. You do not have to take part in this Pilot to receive treatment at the VA. Your choice will not affect in any way your current or future medical care or any other benefits from the VA to which you are otherwise entitled.

What is a connected device and why might I use one?
A connected device is any device that can connect to the internet so that it can communicate with other devices or computers. Examples of connected devices including smartphones, wearable fitness trackers (like a Fitbit), or a connected blood pressure cuff. Many connected devices let you share your data from the device with other people such as your care provider. If your VA care team asked you to connect your device, they will be able to access the data you choose to share.

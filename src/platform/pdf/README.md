# Accessible PDF Generation

This package provides an API and templates for generating accessible PDFs on the client side.

## Development

### General

To update dependent packages:

`yarn workspace @department-of-veterans-affairs/platform-pdf install`

### Creating new templates

To add a new PDF template, create a new file under the `templates` directory. The filename is used as the key when generating PDF content. First consider if an existing template can meet your project's needs. PDFKit is powerful but tricky to work with, so it's worth following existing templates and making small iterations. Various utility methods are available in the `utils.js` file. Once a new template has been completed, sample output files must be reviewed by the Platform Accessibility team to ensure that they are fully compliant.

#### Testing changes

If you are testing changes to a template, the fastest way to test changes is to use the following command to only build changes to the PDF package and the app you are testing. For instance, if you are testing changes with the Medical Records app, you would use the following command:

`yarn --cwd $( git rev-parse --show-toplevel ) watch --env entry=pdf,medical-records`

NB: you will need to kill and re-start the watch command after each change to the PDF application to see changes.

## Usage

This package provides a single API method for generating PDFs.

```js
generatePdf('template_name', 'generated_file_name', jsonData);
```

Example usage in a VA.gov React application:

```js
import generatePdf from '@department-of-veterans-affairs/platform-pdf';

pdfData = {
    "headerLeft": "Lastname, Firstname",
    "headerRight": "Date of birth: January 1, 1970",
    "footerLeft": "Report generated by My HealtheVet and VA on May 15, 2023",
    "footerRight": "Page %PAGE_NUMBER% of %TOTAL_PAGES%",
    "title": "Blood pressure on April 1, 2022 at 12:34 p.m.",
    "subject": "VA Medical Record",
    "preface": "Your vitals list may not be complete. If you have any questions about your information, visit the FAQs or contact your VA Health care team.",
    "results": {
      "items": [
        {
          "items": [
            {
              "title": "Result",
              "value": "120/80",
              "inline": true
            },
            {
              "title": "Location",
              "value": "Cincinnati VA Medical Center",
              "inline": true
            },
            {
              "title": "Provider notes",
              "value": "None noted",
              "inline": true
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
};
generatePdf('medical_records', 'vitals_report', pdfData);
```

When called, the PDF will be generated and the end user's browser will prompt download with the filename `vitals_report.pdf`.

### PDF Metadata

The following fields must be provided by the caller in the JSON data:

* Title
